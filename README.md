## Overview 

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/cw6_OP5An8s) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval on DeepMind AlphaFold. This is a re-implemention of [Sheng and Jinbo's deep leanring model](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005324) on protein contacts prediction, which is a breakthrough in protein structure prediction. However, unfortunately they did not opensource their codes and models. So its a re-implementation of their methods based on the paper. As their paper reported, deep learning model can significantly improve the accuracy of contacts prediction.

# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Feb, 20 at 12 PM PST - Replicate AlphaFold as best you can. Post your github links in the comment section of the video! I'll give a shoutout to the top 2 entries. I'll send the winner a brand new Nvidia Titan RTX GPU. You can also DM @Sirajraval on twitter or send it to hello@sirajraval.com  , use the tag #alphafoldchallenge on social media. 

This challenge is open to anyone, anywhere in the world. 

### I'm looking for

- Good Documentation 
- Working, readable code


Wizards, see page 11 of this [paper](http://predictioncenter.org/casp13/doc/CASP13_Abstracts.pdf) and DeepMind's [blog post](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphafold/) for details on the AlphaFold algorithm. 2 Residual networks are used. Multiple methods are attempted. 

This code is one very related example to AlphaFold. Here are others that you can build off of

- https://github.com/carlosmartinezvillar/3DCNNFolds 
- https://github.com/igemsoftware2017/AiGEM_TeamHeidelberg2017/blob/master/DeeProtein/DeeProtein_README.md
- https://github.com/pfnet-research/BMI219-2017-ProteinFolding
- https://github.com/5bingstar/Deep-learning-for-contact_map_v2
- https://github.com/Illumina/PrimateAI 

Do the best you can! I'm looking for well documented code. Good luck!
